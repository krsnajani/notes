** Distribution when lineal desecendents
When there are
- Children
- Grandchilren
- Great-Grandchildren
- Remote Descendents = Any descendents that come after the GGrandchildren

Section 37, 38, 39 applies to descendents of the same generation.
- 37 pertains to children *only*
- 38 pertains to grandchilren *only*
- 39 pertains to great-grandchildren and rmeote descendents *only*

But when the descendents are of different classes - Section 40 will apply.


** When no lineal descendents
If the father is alive, then notwithstanding the prsence of legal heirs, he will succeed over the entire property. Whereas the mother must inherit equally with the other descendents. The Law Commission has recommended that the law from 42-46 must be altered in the following form

- If parents are survivors, then the parents have to inherit equally.
- If the father is surviving in the presence of other legal heirs he must inherit in equal proportion with the other heirs.

Section 48 - Where the intestate has left neither lineal descendant, nor parent, nor brother, nor sister, his property shall  be divided equally among those of his relatives who are in the nearest degree of kindred to him.

The suit property is a cottage purchased by SL Singh and BC Singh in joint ownership. Utarid comes to visit them and begins staying at the property. BC Singh asks Utarid to live in the Annex of the property. A few years later SL Singh dies intestate. Both Singh and Utarid claim that the property should come to them in succession. They both accept the existance of a sister Ida but they claim she cannot inherit because she has Pakistani Citizenship.

1. What is the disputed share of the property?
   
2. Under Section 48 who will inherit the property
   
   Husband and Wife purchased the property in joint ownership. In the first instance, each owns only 1/2 share in the property. When the wife dies 1/2 share of the Wife is available for succession. Reading Section 33 and 35, Husband will obtain 1/4 (1/2 x 1/2). The contested share is 1/4.
   
3. Does nationality of the legal heir impact their right to inherit under ISA.
   
   Nowhere under the ISA has the law created any citizenship based limitation for succession.
   
4. Why was the matter decided under Section 48 rather than 47
   
   Primairly because the claimant is Utarid who is a kindered and his rights as against Singh is to be determined. The sister is nowhere in the picture. Had she also been an interested party, the dispute would have been decided according to 47 


*** Lillyama v. Joshua & Ors. (Telangana HC)
X is the deceased. Parents of X are pre-deceased. He is survived by Paternal Uncle and Maternal Aunt. The Uncle has 3 sons also. Determine the shares.

- Both Uncle and Aunt are equally distant in kinship from X. Because 27 states that both sides of the family will be equally situated both Agnatic and Cognatic Relative will inherit together.

- In the case the Court's position is that S. 27 only applies in cases where both parents have some form of /common ancester/. The provision does not state anything to this effect. The purpose of 27 is merely to clarify the status of heirs during the process of succession.

- The Court's position is that the entire group of agnatic heirs will heirs.


*** Mary Roy v. State of Kerela
When MR's father died, he was survived by the Wife, Son and Daughter (Mary Roy)

- Part A states were those that were erstwhile part of the British Empire, Part B - Princely States and Part C were Chief Commissioner's provinces.
- Laws applicable to the Britsh empire continued to apply to Part A states and in the Part C states. In Part B states, the law applicable in the erstwhile Part B states continued to apply.
- The State of Kerela had three regions - Travencore, Cochin and Malabar. Travencore and Cochin had their own laws on succession - Travencore Succession Act, Cochin Succession Act. The three areas were put together to setup the setup the State of Kerela.
- MR's case is thus - /"On the intestate succession of her father, which of the three laws is going to apply?"/
- Unlike the ISA both Sons and Daughters were not equally situated in the Travencore Act.
  - If someone dies intestate, and has a Son, the whole inheritance will go to the Son.
  - If a woman has obtained some form of stridhan then she forgoes her claim in the sucession
  - The widow will have a limited estate.
- In MR's case, the Mother only got a limited estate, and the Son obtained the entire succession. MR filed a WP in the SC challenging the unconstitutional
- The Court in this regard, did not investigate the constitutionality of the Act but rather foccused on clarifying the applicable law in MR's case which would give her the required remedy.
- The Court finds that on the re-organisation of the State of Kerela a statute pointed to the fact
- The inheritance can be opned up retrospecitvely and it can be redistributed retrospectively.
- A Study done by CSDS Kerela observed that
  - Fear that after MR's case inheritances that have already been settled will be re-opened. But the CSDS study showed that such was not the case.
  - No of wills in Kerela increased where the daughters have been disinherited and Sons have been given the absolute right over the property
  - If daughters were given stridhan during marriage they were relinquishing their share in the inheritance. This is called the culture of disinheritance in India.

* Testamentary Succession

** Wills
- A legal declaration of mind of testator as to how their property should be distributed or managed after the death of the deceased.
- It can be written at any time during the lifetime of the deceased but is executed only after death.
- Other dispositions always come into effect when the transaction takes place, whereas a will comes into effect only after the death of the testator. Other disposition can also not be revoked during the lifetime of the maker of the disposition, whereas the testator can revoke the will at any point of time during the lifetime of the testator.

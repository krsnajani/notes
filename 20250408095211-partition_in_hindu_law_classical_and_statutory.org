#+title: Partition in Hindu Law - Classical and Statutory


Partition

Classical Mitakshara Law
1956 Act
2005 Amendment Act


- Two main forms of Partition, de jure and de facto.
  - In de jure only common ownership breaks, common possession and common enjoyment does not break.
  - In de facto (actual physical division) in addition to common ownership, common possession and common enjoyment is also broken.
  - Every property is not capable of being partitioned, this is called an impartible property. In such properties the Courts have held that there must be continuance of common enjoyment. 
- Value of the goods that are partitioned should not be lost, or reduced or the property should not be substantially damaged. This is governed by the Principle of Owelty. Where the property is impartible and has been transferred to one of the sharer’s, the other sharer’s staking claim may be given monetary compensation in this regard. 
- Even after this, the property cannot be divided, then it may be sold

- Under the classical law, the coparceners did not have the right to will the property that was obtained through partition, but in the amended act (2005) the coparcener can make a will on the coparcener property.

Section 6 as in 1956
#+begin_quote
When a male  Hindu dies after the commencement of this Act having at the time of his  death an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property, his interest in  the property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members  of the coparcenary and not in accordance with this Act:

Provided that, if the deceased had left him surviving a female relative  specified in class I of the Schedule or a male relative specified in that  class who claims through such female relative, the interest of the  deceased in the Mitakshara coparcenary property shall devolve by  testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be, under this  Act and not by survivorship.

Explanation 1. – For the purpose of this section, the interest of a Hindu  Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the property  that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had  taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he  was entitled to claim partition or not.

Explanation 2. – Nothing contained in the proviso to this section shall  be construed as enabling a person who has separated himself from the  coparcenary before the death of the deceased or any of his heirs to  claim on intestacy a share in the interest referred to therein.
